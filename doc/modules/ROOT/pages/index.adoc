== What Youâ€™ll Learn

In this guide, you will deploy the Hazelcast cluster to Kubernetes using Hazelcast Platform Operator.

== Prerequisites

* Up and running https://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes] cluster (version 1.9 or higher)
* Kubernetes command-line tool, https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl[kubectl]

== Deploy Hazelcast Platform Operator

To deploy Hazelcast Platform Operator you need to apply `bundle.yaml` that includes all the operator components:

[source, bash]
----
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator-docs/main/bundle.yaml
----

Check the CRDs to make sure they were successfully created:

[source, bash]
----
$ kubectl get crd
NAME                              CREATED AT
hazelcasts.hazelcast.com          2021-11-15T14:37:36Z
managementcenters.hazelcast.com   2021-11-15T14:37:36Z
----

Check that the operator is up and running:

[source, bash]
----
$ kubectl get deployment
NAME                                    READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
hazelcast-platform-controller-manager   1/1     1            1           14m
----

== Create Hazelcast cluster

Hazelcast Platform Operator can create both Enterprise and Community Hazelcast clusters. To create the cluster you need to create the Hazelcast Custom Resource.

[tabs]
====

Hazelcast Platform Enterprise cluster::
+
--
For the Hazelcast Platform Enterprise, you need to create a secret with the Hazelcast Enterprise license key.

[source, shell]
----
kubectl create secret generic hz-license-key --from-literal license-key=<hz-license-key>
----

Then run the following command to create the cluster.
[source, shell]
----
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: hazelcast.com/v1alpha1
kind: Hazelcast
metadata:
  name: hazelcast
spec:
  clusterSize: 3
  repository: 'docker.io/hazelcast/hazelcast-enterprise'
  version: '5.0-slim'
  licenseKeySecret: hazelcast-license-key
EOF
----
--

Hazelcast Platform cluster::
+
--
For the Hazelcast Platform run the following command to create the cluster.
[source, shell]
----
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: hazelcast.com/v1alpha1
kind: Hazelcast
metadata:
  name: hazelcast
spec:
  clusterSize: 3
  repository: 'docker.io/hazelcast/hazelcast'
  version: '5.0-slim'
EOF
----
--

====

You can check that the cluster is being created by checking the pods.

[source, shell]
----
kubectl get po
NAME                                                     READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
hazelcast-0                                              0/1     ContainerCreating   0          3s
hazelcast-platform-controller-manager-5b56864bd5-wcqw9   1/1     Running             0          42m
----

== Check Hazelcast cluster status

To check that the Hazelcast cluster is formed you can check the status of the Hazelcast Custom Resource.

[source, shell]
----
$ kubectl get hazelcast
NAME        STATUS    MEMBERS
hazelcast   Running   3/3
----

For a more detailed view you can see the `yaml` format.

[source, shell]
----
$ kubectl get hazelcast -o=yaml
apiVersion: v1
items:
- apiVersion: hazelcast.com/v1alpha1
  kind: Hazelcast
  metadata:
..................
  spec:
    clusterName: dev
    clusterSize: 3
    exposeExternally: {}
    licenseKeySecret: hazelcast-license-key
    repository: docker.io/hazelcast/hazelcast-enterprise
    version: "5.0"
  status:
    hazelcastClusterStatus:
      readyMembers: 3/3
    phase: Running
kind: List
metadata:
  resourceVersion: ""
  selfLink: ""
----

== Create ManagementCenter

Hazelcast Platform Operator can also create ManagementCenter. For this run the following command.

[source, shell]
----
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: hazelcast.com/v1alpha1
kind: ManagementCenter
metadata:
  name: managementcenter
spec:
  repository: 'hazelcast/management-center'
  version: '5.0'
  licenseKeySecret: hazelcast-license-key
  externalConnectivity:
    type: LoadBalancer
  hazelcastClusters:
    - address: hazelcast
      name: dev
  persistence:
    enabled: true
    size: 10Gi
EOF
----

This will create the ManagementCenter Custom Resource and will deploy the ManagementCenter application.
Run the following command to check that the ManagementCenter was successfully deployed.

[source, shell]
----
$ kubectl get managementcenter
NAME               STATUS
managementcenter   Running
----

With this configuration, ManagementCenter will be exposed using LoadBalancer external IP.
[source, shell]
----
$ kubectl get svc
NAME               TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                        AGE
hazelcast          ClusterIP      10.96.213.134   <none>        5701/TCP                       11m
managementcenter   LoadBalancer   10.96.200.154   35.241.11.15  8080:31720/TCP,443:31858/TCP   2m57s
----

Open 35.241.11.15 in your browser to access ManagementCenter.

== Clen up

To delete the Hazelcast cluster and ManagementCenter simply delete the Custom Resources.
[source, shell]
----
$ kubectl delete hazelcast hazelcast
hazelcast.hazelcast.com "hazelcast" deleted

$ kubectl delete managementcenter managementcenter
managementcenter.hazelcast.com "managementcenter" deleted
----

Use `kubectl delete` command to undeploy the operator.
[source, shell]
----
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator-docs/main/bundle.yaml
----

== Summary

In this example, we have seen how to use Hazelcast Platform Operator to deploy and manage the Hazelcast Platform cluster and ManagementCenter.
